# splash
Unix Splash Screen Workflow Tool - WIP

## Description
Splash provides a command-line interface for rendering raw-data directly onto your desktop.

It creates an X11-Window with an OpenGL context, as well as some example shader programs for rendering the data.

It allows you to place the OpenGL renderer anywhere on your screen for nice visual effects.

Tested on Ubuntu18 with Openbox.

Made in C++

## To Do
Currently, I am still working on proper modularization of the visualization programs, as well as the universal piping of data.
