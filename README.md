# Splash
Unix Splash Screen Workflow Tool

## Description
Splash is an interface for piping data

## Structure
Splash creates a borderless, backgroundless X11 window with an OpenGL context.

Piping splash data will allow splash to visualize the data dynamically in 3D,
with possibility for interaction and on-desktop data visualization.

In this way, it can be used for programming custom interactive 3D widgets on your desktop.

Tested on Ubuntu18 with Openbox.
